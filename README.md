## Hello, World!


I am a Front-End Developer with experience in design and programming, bilingual in French and Spanish, with fluent English. Beyond the technical side, I am an organized person with a curiosity that led me to undertake my own projects, publish my own book independently, and work as a freelancer for several years.

Currently, I collaborate on projects as a Front-End Developer, working with technologies like React, TypeScript, Vite, and Vitest. Academically, I hold advanced studies in Graphic and Multimedia Design, complemented by a programming bootcamp and a Masterâ€™s degree in Front-End Development.
